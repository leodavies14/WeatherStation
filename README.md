### Project Description

Designed and developed a personal weather station for use at home, the office, etc.

Using a FRDM-KL46Z board, we integrated 3 sensors and a display into a personal weather station. We allowed for the measurement of 3 values: wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall. This small, cheaper model could be used to get precise measurements at a location of interest for the everyday user. 

The main code is run on the weatherstation.c file. The Anemometer, Rain, and Wind Vane files are used to initialize the 3 sensors. The Time and LCD files are used to initialize the board display and time feature. We utilized the button on the FRDM-KL46Z board to allow users to switch between display options, which included time, wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall. These measurements each had a seperate display for the user to toggle through at their leasure.

Included in this repository are some photos to illustrate the system and control flow. Thanks for visiting!
